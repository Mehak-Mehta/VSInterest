   We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting an issue
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

# How Can I Help?
By doing any of the above!

# Development System
All the changes happen through pull requests here. So start by creating an issue first, so that I know what you are working on.
